 * @title ECDSA Multi Ownership Authorization Module for Biconomy Smart Accounts.
 * @dev Compatible with Biconomy Modular Interface v 0.1
 *         - It allows to validate user operations signed by EOA private key.
 *         - EIP-1271 compatible (ensures Smart Account can validate signed messages).
 *         - Multiple owners per Smart Account.
 *         - Does not support outdated eth_sign flow for cheaper validations
 *         (see https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/14764161421467-What-is-eth-sign-and-why-is-it-a-risk-)
